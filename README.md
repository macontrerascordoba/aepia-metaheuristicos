# Assigment 3.5 for Course "Resolución de problemas con metaheurísticos 25-26"

This code was made as an ampliation of [the code created by Francisco Chicano for the course "Evolutionary Algorithms" of the Master in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Malaga (Spain)](https://github.com/NEO-Research-Group/SimpleEvolutionaryAlgorithm). This code include the original algorithm plus a 2 additional algorithms: Brute Force and Simulated Annealing. Also, applies all algorithms to the [QUBO problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) and implements a code in python to automatize the tests.
